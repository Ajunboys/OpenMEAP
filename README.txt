OpenMEAP 1.0.0a

Herein is the very first alpha release of OpenMEAP.  We
understand well that the code is far from perfect and 
that there are many things that need to be done in order
for this to be a production-ready platform.

That being said, we do believe that there is a bit
of research and development value in what we have put 
together thus far and that, humbly hopeful, someone may 
find even further use from it.

Beyond that, we are looking forward to engaging the 
community and this alpha release is intended to inspire
first-round feedback on the direction of the project.

So, in the spirit of friendship, we give to you, 

OpenMEAP 1.0.0a,
