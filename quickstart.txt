OpenMEAP was created in 
	xCode 4.2
	Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers (w/ the IvyDE plugin)
http://www.eclipse.org/
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/

OpenMEAP web projects have been tested on Apache Tomcat 5.5 and 6.0
http://tomcat.apache.org/

OpenMEAP command-line requires Apache Ant 1.8 or greater.
http://ant.apache.org/


+==================
1) Every shell session

Correct the environment variables in this file to match your environment
(setEnv.bat file if running in Windows)

	$ . ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh

+==================
2) Building the web projects
	
Build the web projects (only need to do this once)
Builds openmeap-admin-web.war and openmeap-services-web.war
These can be dropped in apache tomcat's webapps directory

You'll need to login to /openmeap-admin-web/interface/ 
with a user who has the two roles openmeap-admin and openmeap-user
so, you'll need to update the tomcat-users.xml in tomcat's conf directory

	$ cd ${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools
	$ ant dist-all-web
	
The resulting artifacts will end up in ${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools/dist

+==================
3) Creating and building clients
	
Create an arbitrarily located/named directory for new SLICs

	$ mkdir ~/om_client
	$ cd ~/om_client

Copy over the client.properties template provided

	om_client $ cp $OPENMEAP_HOME/build-tools/template/client.properties .

Correct the properties to match your environment

	om_client $ vi client.properties
	
Create the assets folder (whatever you updated client.properties with)
and copy in the openmeap.js

	om_client $ mkdir assets
	om_client $ cd assets
	assets $ cp ${OPENMEAP_HOME}/clients/shared/javascript/openmeap.js .
	
Create DHTML application

	assets $ vi index.html
	...
	assets $ cd .. 

List what you can do (illustrative, here, only)

	om_client $ om_ios.sh -p
	
Publish the shared and slic-core projects to the local repository.
The openmeap-shared and openmeap-slic-core project artifacts must be available
within the local ivy repository, in order to perform command-line builds for 
Android.  This step only needs to be performed when these projects have 
changed.

	$ . ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools/scripts/setEnv.sh
	$ cd ./${OPENMEAP_HOME}/build-tools
	$ ant publish-local-shared
	$ ant publish-local-slic-core

Create and build your iOS project.  Opens and runs in xCode 4.2

	om_client $ om_ios.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties
	om_client $ om_ios.sh build-debug -propertyfile client.properties

Create and build your android project.  Install to a device using adb
See the android docs for how to do this.  The build.xml in the android
SLIC directory is what was created by the android sdk.

	om_client $ om_android.sh create-project -propertyfile client.properties
	om_client $ om_android.sh build-debug -propertyfile client.properties

+==================	
*) Import Android SLIC projects into Eclipse

In order to import an Android project into into Eclipse,
you must first make sure to import the openmeap-shared, openmeap-slic-core,
and openmeap-slic-android projects into the target workspace.

Because you must import these, you must also specify the openmeap.home
and android.sdk.home ant properties as mentioned in the quickstart-eclipse.txt
file.

Next you must choose you must create a New Android project, 
then select to create from existing source.  The source root
must be whereever you directed the command-line script to create
the SLIC.
