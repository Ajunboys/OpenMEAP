The following is a quick-start set of instructions for setting up an
OpenMEAP development environment in Eclipse for Java EE developers.

1) Install the Android SDK

2) Create a new workspace in Eclipse (not at openmeap home)

3) De-select to build automatically from the project drop-down

4) Install the Android Development Tools for Eclipse, using the instructions here:
	http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing
	
5) Install IvyDE using the instructions here:
	http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/history/latest-milestone/install.html

6) Setup the Ant properties
- Open workspace preferences, expand ant, select runtime, 
  then click the properties tab
- Add an "openmeap.home" property entry pointing to where you have the openmeap 
  source package unzipped
- Add an "android.sdk.home" property entry pointing to where you have the 
  android sdk installed.

7) Correct/verify the Android SDK location
Still in workspace preferences, select the Android tab
correct the Android sdk location, if this wasn't covered by the ADT install

8) Install the Apache Tomcat 5.5 server runtime (required by admin and services)
- Download and unzip Apache Tomcat 5.5 somewhere you are comfortable with it 
  living
- Open workspace preferences, expand "Server", select "Runtime environments"
- Click "Add"
- Select "Apache 5.5"
- Browse to where you downloaded and unzipped Apache Tomcat 5.5

9) Import "build-tools" and configure the Ivy settings for workshop

	- Right-click on the "Package Explorer" pane,
	- Select Import, then "Import ..."
	- Expand General, then select "Import projects into workspace"
	- In "Select root directory" browse to the OpenMEAP source root
	- Seeing that only the "build-tools" project is selected for import,
	- Click finish
	
	- Open Eclipse "Preferences", expand Ivy, then Settings
	- For "Ivy settings path", Click "Workspace..." and select 
		ivysettings.xml under build-tools
	- For "Property files", Click "Workspace..." and select 
		ant.properties under build-tools

10) Import, resolve Ivy dependencies and build all the projects

For the least pain, import and build the projects in groups in the order below
	
	openmeap-shared
	openmeap-shared-jdk5
	openmeap-shared-serverside
	
	openmeap-admin-web
	openmeap-services-web
	
	openmeap-slic-core
	openmeap-slic-android
	openmeap-slic-android-test (not used yet)
	
	banking-web

For each grouping above, do the following:
	- Right-click on the "Package Explorer" pane,
	- Select Import, then "Import ..."
	- Expand General, then select "Import projects into workspace"
	- In "Select root directory" browse to the OpenMEAP source root
	- Seeing that the group of projects desired are selected for import,
	- Click finish
	- Right click on each imported project and select "Ivy"->"resolve"
	- Wait, then build each as the Ivy dependencies are resolved
